### Brief description
 
This took me around 2 or 3 hours, I first created the _hmtl_ file where I created the 3 boxes where I decided to use Authors instead of it being a menu, just for a change. I also decided to change the colors and some other things in the css styling sheet. The most challenging part was definitely the responsive development.
